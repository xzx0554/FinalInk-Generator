# FinalInk Generator

**FinalInk Generator** is not just an artistic tool—it is an **assistive algorithm** inspired by the moment when a person, near the end of life, may lose the ability to speak and can only communicate by handwriting.

The project aims to **simulate and study "final strokes"**: fragile, trembling, fading handwriting that often occurs in conditions such as late-stage illness, neurological decline, or during palliative care. By generating synthetic data of such handwriting, this tool supports research in:

* **OCR robustness** for weak or irregular handwriting
* **Assistive communication systems** for patients who rely on written text as their last expressive channel
* **Human-centered design** for technologies in end-of-life care

## Features

* ​**End-of-life handwriting simulation**​: models trembling, fading, broken strokes reflecting the condition of the writer.
* ​**Configurable distortions**​: control tremor, stroke weakness, irregular spacing, and fading intensity.
* ​**Data generation for research**​: outputs paired text and handwriting-like images for OCR training and evaluation.
